## This file is for application designed by the Global Logic Online Assessment. 
### This application is used to implement a dashboard that provide the data of launched cars as well as upcoming cars with several functionalities listed below:
1. Dashboard should provide quarterly timeline (Q1 2020, Q2 2020, Q3 2020 and Q4 2020) of launched or upcoming cars. This timeline should be collapsible and expandable based on the quarter selected by clicking "quarter" on the table.
2. Clicking on any particular make/model should provide detailed summary of the car (I only included car make, model, type, and price in my database) in the modal.
3. Simple node and mongo for Data in the backend. I used MongoDB cluster so my collabortors should be able to access the data.
4. React used to implement the front-end.

### To run this application
1. cd to server, run "npm install" to install node modules and run "node index.js"
2. cd to client, run "npm install" to install node modules and run "npm start"
